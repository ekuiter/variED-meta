In my industrial experience I helped companies to formalize their system's variability. For feature modelling you usually need to iterate with domain experts until their view of the variability matches with the feature model. As an example, feature hierarchy should be meaningful to their mental model. As another more fine-grained example, if a feature can be subfeature of two different features, they probably should select a feature as parent and add a ""requires"" constraint for the other. For these workshops, collaborative feature modeling was needed.",1,3,"Version control system, or direct manipulation of the feature model with several persons in place",Slightly satisfied,No significant problems.,Specially in pure research work where no customer will have to validate it and normally you do it alone. This does not makes sense in industry where the feature model will need to be iterated with domain experts that might come from different disciplines within the same company.,"I had a group of 6 Master students collaboratively creating a feature model of 115 features during the implementation of an SPL. It was interesting, you can take a look at [...]  As another comment, feature interactions or derivative features is still a quite challenging topic in feature modeling, but well, maybe unrelated to collaborative feature modeling.",Satisfied,In collaborative feature modeling probably there are different roles or experts from different disciplines or subsystems. Maybe a way to tag or bookmark features according to different perspectives. This can be used for filtering the model or model slicing.,The workshops with the persons involved can be more interactive and dynamic.,The tool is missing some other general feature modelling capabilities. I will be interested in adding quality attribute annotations to features for example.,"No, I really like this browser-based FeatureIDE-style editor with collaborative capabilities. Congratulations."
